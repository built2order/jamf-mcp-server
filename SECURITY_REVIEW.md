# Security Review: Jamf MCP Server Command Execution Tools

## Executive Summary

This security review examines tools in the Jamf MCP Server that can execute commands, deploy software, or make changes to managed devices. The review found **good security practices** overall, with appropriate safeguards for dangerous operations.

## Tools That Execute Commands on Devices

### 1. **executePolicy** (src/tools/index-compat.ts:673)
- **Purpose**: Executes Jamf policies on specified devices
- **Security Controls**:
  ✅ Requires explicit confirmation (`confirm: true`)
  ✅ Respects read-only mode
  ✅ Clear error messages when confirmation missing
- **Risk Level**: HIGH (can execute arbitrary policies)

### 2. **deployScript** (src/tools/index-compat.ts:694)
- **Purpose**: Deploys and executes scripts on devices
- **Security Controls**:
  ✅ Requires explicit confirmation (`confirm: true`)
  ✅ Respects read-only mode
  ✅ Graceful fallback for Classic API limitations
- **Risk Level**: HIGH (can execute arbitrary scripts)

### 3. **updateInventory** (src/tools/index-compat.ts:402)
- **Purpose**: Forces inventory update on devices
- **Security Controls**:
  ✅ Respects read-only mode
  ⚠️ NO confirmation required
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM (triggers data collection, not arbitrary execution)

## Read-Only Mode Implementation

The server implements a comprehensive read-only mode:

```typescript
// Environment variable check (src/index.ts:28)
const READ_ONLY_MODE = process.env.JAMF_READ_ONLY === 'true';

// Client enforcement (src/jamf-client-hybrid.ts)
if (this.readOnlyMode) {
  throw new Error('Cannot execute policies in read-only mode');
}
```

## Security Recommendations

### 1. Add Confirmation to updateInventory
While inventory updates are less dangerous than policy execution, they still trigger device actions. Consider adding an optional confirmation parameter:

```typescript
const UpdateInventorySchema = z.object({
  deviceId: z.string().describe('The device ID to update inventory for'),
  confirm: z.boolean().optional().default(false).describe('Confirmation flag for inventory update'),
});
```

### 2. Rate Limiting
No rate limiting is currently implemented. Consider adding:
- Per-device execution limits
- Time-based rate limiting
- Concurrent execution limits

### 3. Audit Logging
While the README mentions "all operations are logged", the actual implementation only logs to stderr. Consider:
- Structured logging for security events
- Separate audit log for command executions
- Include user/session information

### 4. Policy/Script Validation
Current implementation executes any policy/script ID without validation. Consider:
- Whitelist of allowed policies/scripts
- Policy category restrictions
- Pre-execution validation hooks

## Software Deployment Capabilities

The server enables software deployment through:
1. **Policy execution** - Primary method for software installation
2. **Script deployment** - Can be used for custom installations
3. **deploy-software prompt** - Guides users through deployment workflow

All require explicit confirmation, which is good practice.

## Authentication & Authorization

The server supports two authentication methods:
1. OAuth2 (Modern API) - More secure, token-based
2. Basic Auth → Bearer Token - Legacy support

**Note**: No fine-grained authorization is implemented. Any authenticated user can execute all commands (unless in read-only mode).

## Positive Security Features

1. ✅ **Explicit confirmation** for dangerous operations
2. ✅ **Read-only mode** for safe exploration
3. ✅ **Clear error messages** guide users to safe practices
4. ✅ **No hardcoded credentials** in codebase
5. ✅ **HTTPS enforcement** via axios configuration
6. ✅ **Token expiration handling** with automatic refresh

## Conclusion

The Jamf MCP Server implements reasonable security controls for a device management tool. The confirmation requirements and read-only mode provide good safeguards against accidental or malicious command execution. The main areas for improvement are:
1. Adding confirmation to inventory updates
2. Implementing rate limiting
3. Adding proper audit logging
4. Considering policy/script whitelisting

For production use, these additional controls would significantly enhance security posture.
